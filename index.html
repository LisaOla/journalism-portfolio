            <h1>SWEDEN MINORITIES MISS OUT MILLIONS </h2>
            <h2>Sweden’s minorities miss outon millions whilestategrants are
              spent mainly“on administration”</h5>
            <div class="galary" style="height:500px; width: 100px;"><img src="img/minority1.png" alt="news1" width="600" height="500"></div>
            <p>A year after year, Swedish municipalities pile up the state money allocated to support minorities while international community alarms about poor state of their rights in this Scandinavian country Sari Ebesoh’s from Gothenburg is a mother of an international family: she’s Finnish, her husband is Nigerian,
              and their children are growing up in Sweden. With more than three languages spoken at home, Sari wants
              her kids to be fluent in Finnish as well. Despite this right provided by law, the woman is almost unable to
              count on schooling for it.
              Her two young daughters, five and eight years old, didn’t have Finnish classes at their home school. So in
              order to attend afternoon mother tongue classes, they had to take a tram to Frölunda, a troubled area in the
              south of Gothenburg. “I cannot let them go during the afternoons by themselves. It was really a struggle”,
              Sari explains, adding that she wasn’t able to give children lifts due to her tight work schedule.
              Swedish municipalities can’t afford sustainable mother tongue tuition, though the state costs for granting
              minorities rights are growing every year. Sweden is home to large populations of Finns, Sami, Tornedal,
              Romani, and Yiddish which constitute up to eight per cent of Sweden’s ten-million population. Council of
              Europe had been criticizing the country’s approach to its minority policy for the past decade and a half.
              
              Since 2010, the Minority Act granted them enhanced rights including language learning, mother tongue pre-
              school tuition, and elderly care. The municipalities that have chosen to be part of administrative areas for the
              
              minorities receive an annual state grant based on their total population, which is 66 million SEK on average.
              Over the course since the Act came into effect, all Swedish municipalities have piled up 52 million SEK
              altogether.</h5>

            <h1>Hazardous substances on the EU markets</h2>
            <h2>Customers are looking for cheap clothes, without paying attention to their quality; do you expect  a trouser with 50 kronor to be with a high quality?” Kiosk’s owner at Kviberg street market.  </h5>
            <div class="galary" style="height:500px; width: 100px;"><img src="img/hazardous1.png" alt="news1" width="600" height="500"></div>
            <p>Hundreds of street stalls and kiosks inside and outside several hangars are forming Kviberg street  market in the east part of Gothenburg city, where preferring low price over good quality has led to  an unpleasant experience for some of the customers. Sandra Ivoq 25 years old, a frequent customer  of Kviberg street market, explained, “I had a strong skin allergy and rashes after a trouser which I  bought from Kviberg market has dissolved a dye on my skin although I washed it prior to first  use”. 
              
              The quality of the imported clothes are expected to meet a set of EU standards and regulations  which aim to protect the EU consumers from exposition to potentially hazardous chemical  substances to the human body, which are used during the dying process of the clothes. The  European countries introduced the REACH legislation, which imposes restrictions on the use of  chemical substances in the production of textile articles due to their potential danger to the  human body. The REACH legislation has listed substances of very high concern that have serious  effects on the human health, substances that are endocrine disruptors, carcinogenic, or are  highly allergenic. The regulation applies to all chemicals imported or produced in the EU and must  be controlled by all of the EU member states. The fail of implementing this regulation can lead to  a serious health risk to the EU consumers considering the harmful effects of the chemical  substances used in dyeing the textile and the clothes. 
              Majority of clothes sold in the European Union imported from outside the EU. Some of these  clothes, which have cheaper price but a questionable quality that can cause risk to the human  body,sold in street markets in many of the EU markets such as Duisburg Market in Germany, Flea  Market in the Czech Republic, and Kviberg Market in Sweden. 
              According to the Swedish Chemical Agency (KEMI), there is a lack of adequate control of  hazardous substances in the imported textile articles, since the authorization system only applied  on the imported chemical substances used in the manufacturing processinside the EU. This mean  that the control process does not meet the requirements stated under the REACH legislation to  control all of the imported chemical substances. 
              The Customs Administration in Czech Republic as one of the EU authorities who are responsible  to implement the EU regulations, explained that the manufacturers and importers have to  register chemical substances, which imported in quantities, only if these quantities exceeded one  ton per importer per year; they also explained that the chemical substances in the imported textile are not controlled.  
              One of the textile importers who distribute to Kviberg street market explained, “The goods  entered the EU legally after the payment of the customs taxes. Most of the goods imported from 
              By Lisha 
              China, Bangladesh, and Korea. The goods are sold not only in Sweden but also in Germany, the  Czech Republic, Netherlands, and many of the other EU countries, and usually sold in street  markets similar to Kviberg market”  
              While many European textile companies require their suppliers outside the EU to comply with  the EU regulations around the use of hazardous substances during the production of textile and  clothes, it can be difficult to small importing companies to impose similar demands on their  suppliers. Many of the small importers sell their imported goods in street markets, which are the  destinations of many EU consumers who are looking for cheaper-price clothes. Some of these  clothes can contain hazardous substances as result of using chemical substances during the  dyeing process, substances that banned under the EU regulations. 
              Risks to the human body are possible from the use of hazardous substances in the dye of textile. “In case of high usage of chemical substances in dyeing the clothes, this can cause skin problems,  itching, skin rash, and even can cause cancerous skin diseases on the long term, since the clothes  touch the skin directly” Dermatologist George Tannous. 
              In their daily life, the consumers increasingly exposed to hundreds of hazardous materials, which  can exist in their clothes and present a direct danger to their health. The process of dyeing the  clothes involves the usage of a wide range of chemical substances that present risk to the human  body. Although the existence of EU regulations on the importation of hazardous chemical  substances, the inadequate process of implementing these regulations to control the existence  of the chemical substances in the imported textile, can expose many of the EU consumers to  health risks especially that the majority of the clothes on the EU markets are imported from  outside the EU.
